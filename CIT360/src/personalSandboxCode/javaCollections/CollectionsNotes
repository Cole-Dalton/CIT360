*** ArrayLists and LinkedLists Notes ***

- A LinkedList is an unsorted collection where objects can be added any number of times
- An ArrayList is a collection that is accessed like an array and can be sorted

- The main differences between ArrayLists and LinkedLists are in the way data is stored and removed.
With a LinkedList, adding items to the list does not cause the neighboring elements to be moved
as do ArrayLists. Only the pointers are changed in LinkedLists(which point to locations of elements
in memory for access), whereas with ArrayLists, all elements need to be shifted up after the insertion.
This is less efficient. LinkedLists also use a "First in First out" methodology when inserting or removing
items from the list. However a drawback of LinkedLists is the fact that you don't refer to an element by index
in the same way that you you can with ArrayLists. You need an Iterator to traverse through each of the pointers to
get to the element you want to access. Searching (get method) in ArrayLists is much faster, while adding and removing
elements in LinkedLists is faster than ArrayLists.

* Basics of HashMap
A HashMap uses a mapping between a key and a value. You can create it, add some keys and corresponding values, then
refer to the key or value using methods from the HashMap import.
