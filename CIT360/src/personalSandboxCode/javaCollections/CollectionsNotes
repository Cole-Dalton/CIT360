*** ArrayLists and LinkedLists Notes ***

- The main differences between ArrayLists and LinkedLists are in the way data is stored and removed.
With a LinkedList, adding items to the list does not cause the neighboring elements to be moved
as do ArrayLists. Only the pointers are changed in LinkedLists(which point to locations of elements
in memory for access), whereas with ArrayLists, all elements need to be shifted up after the insertion.
This is less efficient. However a drawback of LinkedLists is the fact that you can't refer to an element
by index as you can with ArrayLists. You need an Iterator to traverse through each of the pointers to
get to the element you want to access. Searching (get method) in ArrayLists is much faster, while adding and removing
elements in LinkedLists is faster than ArrayLists.
